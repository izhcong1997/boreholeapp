# boreholeapp

This application is mainly to faciliate storing of information from the traditional Pen & Paper method used by our partner, Land Transport Authority.

The main page has 4 options for the users to choose which input form they are using, before transferring the details onto the database in a generated form format.

Each input form has its unique set of fields.

Data is being transferred using a localhost currently as we did not publish this application on the Apple Store
